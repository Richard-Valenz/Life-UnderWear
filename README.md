# Life-UnderWear
IoT project focused on wearable technology for people with disabilities built with Arduino.


This project works as a set of sensors which together make the whole system of care for disabled or old people who cannot notify whenever they need to be attended.

It was created together with a ready made underwear and a set of special conductive materials and boards to make it work a smart underwear

### Project division

In the following archives you can find each electornic component needed and described for the project. 

1. _Lilypad Arduino Board_ : This board was the one used for this project due to its special characteristics for wearable technologies.

2. _Pulsometer_ : This is a sensor which can detect the heart pulse from the vital signal of our body and plot it as a function of beats per minute (BPM) with respect to time. 

3. _Liquid Sensor_ : This is a sensor which was specially programmed to output the categorical value of whether if the sensor (which would be place inside of the underwear) detectes any kind of humidity produced by the person using it. 

4. _Temperature Sensor_ : This is a sensor which can show you the current temperature as a continuous data in Celsius or Fahrenheit degrees.
